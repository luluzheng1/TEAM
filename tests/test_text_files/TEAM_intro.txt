TEAM provides two built-in libraries: one for string manipulation and another for list manipulation. Both built-in libraries include a collection of useful functions that is accessible to every TEAM program. For more information, a list of our built-in library functions is provided in the LRM. The built-in libraries are scanned and parsed into a separate AST that is later prepended to the AST of the program before they are passed to the semantic analyzer.
